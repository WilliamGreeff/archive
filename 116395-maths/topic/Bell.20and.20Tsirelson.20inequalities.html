<p>Do you think I should try to change it? At the moment it seems to me that it's just going to be cumbersome to restrict the ordering to the self-adjoint elements, and somehow we don't lose anything by just having a partial order on everything.</p>

<p>Do you need an order on the complexes to talk about complex conjugation in this setting?</p>

<p>Yes, you do. The order you want is just the one that makes each horizontal line in the complex plane incomparable with each other line. Would that be unpleasant/wrong to have as an instance? If so, that suggests we should investigate only asking for an order on the self adjoint elements.</p>

<p>Are you really using the order on elements where the imaginary part is nonzero?</p>

<p>If having this as an instance doesn't cause problems elsewhere, that might make a lot of things simpler, like stating inequalities involving complex numbers that we know are always real.</p>

<p>No, I'm not using the order on non-self-adjoint elements at all.</p>

<p>It's a question of whether it's worth the encumbrance of having to define the subtype of self-adjoint elements, and put an order just on that, and then describe how the star interacts with that order.</p>
<p>Or to go with the current alternative, where it's much quicker to say how the order and the star structure should interact.</p>

<p>I guess I better try out making <code>complex</code> a star-ordered ring, and see if anything complains.</p>
