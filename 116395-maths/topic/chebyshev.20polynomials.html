<p><a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/tree/chebpoly">branch#chebpoly</a> is a little experiment that I did for fun. And it turned out to be a lot of fun!<br>
It's 350 lines of code where I mix polynomials, trigonometric functions and zmod p.</p>
<p>Everything fit pretty smoothly together, but it will need some cleaning up before it can be PR'd. In particular, it would benefit from having <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/4241">#4241</a> and <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/4197">#4197</a> merged.</p>
<p>The end result is that we get a family of polynomials over Z, that commute with each other, and such that the <code>p</code>-th polynomial is congruent to <code>X ^ p</code> modulo <code>p</code>.</p>

<p>Such a family is a Lambda structure, and there are only two such structures on <code>polynomial int</code>.</p>
