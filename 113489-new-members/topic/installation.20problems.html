<p>I have said before that I <em>really</em> just want one place to point to anyone who says "how do I install lean?" but doesn't tell me which OS they're on. I don't want to have to say "look at the bottom of this page"</p>

<p>I want a page which says "lean and mathlib tools installation instructions" in big letters at the top and then has three highly visible links for Mac, Windows, Linux and then all the nerdy stuff in small letters below</p>

<p>To chime in, supporting Kevin's comments: I did not find installing Lean especially easy.  I could download it, I followed the outlined steps, but I was never really sure that what I was doing was correct.  Also, in the end, VSC did not <em>just work</em>, it still needed a little extra love.  I cannot remember if it did not have a correct path or something.  The final lingering feeling, is that installing Lean felt harder than installing Linux Mint on my computer.</p>

<p>Yeah, it's clear we're not there yet. That said --- an enormous amount of effort has already gone into making installation as painless as possible, all volunteer effort by people with many other things to do. This is an issue that has previously caused strife here, so please everyone let's be as nice as possible to each other while working on installation issues! (I'm not complaining about anything in the current conversation, just trying to keep things on track. :-)</p>

<p>How should we bundle "Lean" in package managers?</p>
<ol>
<li>not-at-all</li>
<li>under the name <code>lean</code>, but actually install <code>elan</code></li>
<li>under the name <code>elan</code><br>
(The other option, which is what we have at the moment in <code>brew</code>, but I think is worse than nothing, is to bundle a fixed version of <code>lean</code> under the name <code>lean</code>.)</li>

<p>Also, I want to point out that the difficulties in installing Lean were resolved in matters of seconds on the Zulip chat, thanks to the incredibly supportive community!</p>
<p>As for the installation, I do not know the difference between <code>lean</code> and <code>elean</code>, but I can say that I did not use the "couple of nights".  For me, the actual options were: </p>
<ol>
<li>using it on the web;</li>
<li>full install.</li>
</ol>
<p>I do not know how other people might feel about this.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="271218">@Thorsten Altenkirch</span> I apologize for the unclear install instructions. What you installed seems to be the core Lean library, which does <strong>not</strong> include the mathematical components (called <code>mathlib</code>). If you work on a new project / install an existing project, using <code>leanproject</code>, you'll get <code>mathlib</code> automatically. See <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/install/project.html">https://leanprover-community.github.io/install/project.html</a></p>

<p>I mean I understand that it is a good idea that projects have their own copy of the lib but there should be a way to use the lib without starting a project.</p>

<p>There is no global installation of the mathlib library. The library changes at an alarming rate, with several PR's accepted per day, This is why I'm here -- I see fast progress.</p>

<p>so the philosophy is that each project comes with its own mathlib,and occsaionally you update. Nothing is backwards compatible though, so updating mathlib can break stuff. We live on the edge.</p>

<p>So how do I install math lib? Thanks Kevin for pointing me to the community page ;-) but it seems the information there is buggy.</p>

<p>You mean the sentence "After this installation procedure, it is crucial to read how to start or get a Lean project. "? Should we add "even if you are Thorsten Altenkirch"?</p>

<p>Hej hej no reason to be sarky. I went through a number of pages and didn't read everything as most people don't. In particular since I only wanted to experiment I didn't feel that I should find out how to start a "lean project". <br>
I installed lean according to the description and then Kevin advised me to "import tactics" which didn't work. He said "you haven't installed it properly" and then I reinstalled it. Eventually people point out to me that I need to start a project. I have used proof assistants before and I never needed to "start a project" to use the standard library. Maybe the <code>lean project global-install</code> should be part of the installation script.</p>

<p>The global install approach causes weird issues that newbies are not prepared to deal with</p>

<p>Many people are indeed eager to start playing instead of reading the instructions, this is very natural. The key trick when this doesn't work is to conceive the idea that maybe <em>you</em> did something wrong. After taking this crucial step, you can either go back to read more carefully or ask questions in a way suggesting you got the key trick. This happened countless times and leads to the slow improvement of the overall installation process, which will probably never ends since this kind of software will probably remain tricky to use forever.</p>

<p>Because mathlib is changing so rapidly, working outside of projects makes it quite inconvenient to share code. If you want to share a Lean file that depends on some version of mathlib, you have to also specify the Lean version and the precise commit of mathlib that it was developed with somehow, otherwise there's a decently high probability your code won't work. The <code>leanpkg.toml</code> file in a project makes that much easier, esp. with the <code>leanproject</code> tooling.</p>

<p>I think it might be good to include a big warning against the global install in the installation instructions. My first instinct was also to do this when I started and of course it didn't work out too well!</p>
