This discipline should be about developing ideas based on rigorous foundations and logic, which is a useful and important purpose. Once you have understood those ideas, even \"advanced\" results often seem quite simple and intuitive, and we can take that understanding and apply it to other work if helps us to make useful progress. However, the amount of needlessly obscure terminology, poor notation and just plain bad writing in formal papers make the whole field absurdly inaccessible, even to many who might have no trouble understanding the underlying concepts and important results.</p>\n<p>Just imagine what would happen if we tried to write engineering specs or software the way postgraduate mathematics research is done. We'd be trying to debug source code where every identifier was a single character, taken from one of three or four different alphabets, with several of them looking similar enough to mistake one for another, with a bunch of combining accent modifiers on top that were used to fundamentally change the semantics of the program, interspersed with comments by someone who needs a remedial class in basic writing skills, full of technical terminology that is defined in terms of other technical terminology from other software packages, except that sometimes the meaning is subtly different in this context but that isn't noted anywhere on the screen at the time, resulting in needing to spend half an hour doing a depth-first-search of all the definitions only to find that a function whose only identifier is the name of the developer who wrote the second version (because the first person to work on it already has another function bearing their name) is actually equivalent to what a programmer would write as</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span>const DAYS_IN_WEEK := 7\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>I write this as someone who studied mathematics to a high level and has touched on the field many times since in connection with heavily mathematical software development.

The learning curve for any computer algebra system is quite steep and all of the other systems relied on \"learn by trial\".</p>\n<p>Now look at Lean. Take, for example, group.lean. It is a wall of text. Finding a theorem relies on odd names like mul_eq_of_eq_inv_mul. The whole of the \"communication\" with people, such as it is, is contained in that name. Programmers made the mistake of this \"pile of sane\" (POS) approach, witness the \"src\", \"inc\", \"tst\", and (usually empty) \"doc\" directories with \"semantic naming\" like parser.c, <a href=\"http://SMTFuns.pl\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://SMTFuns.pl\">SMTFuns.pl</a>, or <a href=\"http://catsim.ml\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://catsim.ml\">catsim.ml</a>.</p>\n<p>Suppose, instead, there was a group theory textbook in latex. The textbook explains the ideas in natural language. It contains all of the lemmas in group.lean, each  one with a paragraph or so of explanation. The lemmas are in named \"chunks\", basically a verbatim block with a name. Lemmas should only be accepted when they contain a paragraph or section in the group theory volume.</p>\n<p>Now you have a book, with a table of contents, a table of equations, chapters, sections, paragraphs, an index, and a bibliography, all hyperlinked and searchable. Since each lemma is in a named verbatim chunk you can extract any or all lemmas automatically, letting the compiler do it. You can find relevant lemmas by looking in the table of contents or the index.</p>\n<p>Code to extract a named chunk is 170 lines of C. Axiom already uses this technology.</p>\n<p>The idea is called \"literate programming\" (Knuth). You write for people, and incidently, write for the machine.

For lean this would likely be coq, where a lot of work (tactics especially) in lean have learned from prior work done in coq, rather than reinvent the wheel.</p>\n<p>2) which of these would be the easiest for mathematicians with some programming experience to learn to use to create machine-verifiable proofs?<br>\nLean of course ;). More seriously that's  a very difficult question to answer as the answer depends on personal preference, how much experience the user has with different types of programming languages. </p>\n<p>3) which of these have a good translator that turns a machine-readable proof into something a human reader might gain insight from?<br>\nNone of them? ISABELLE/NAPROCHE  and forthel are projects that go in that direction, but is more aimed at writing a human readable proof that a machine can read, rather than translation. Peter Koepke and Tom Hales have thought about how this might work in lean but I'm not aware of any publications (yet).</p>",

He told me that bold was the notation in the books originally when notation began to be standardised, and then blackboard bold was invented for blackboards, so the correct notation when working in a non-blackboard format (e.g. print)  is bold.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I have a very strong opinion on this subject. It is one of the few places where I dare to disagree with Lenstra (and Serre!).</p>\n<p>Typography is the art of making things invisible. If you notice the design of some piece of text, it is distracting you from the content. If something stands out, it better be important. For that reason we <em>emphasize</em> the word that is being defined in a certain definition. For that reason, it is okay to print the word <strong>Theorem 2.1</strong> in bold when you state it (but not when you refer to it, probably).<br>\nIn my thesis I went so far as to not have <em>any</em> bold text anywhere. But I think that judicious use of bold text is fine. If a user is searching for a theorem statement, then it can help if the eye is attracted to <strong>Theorem 2.1</strong>.</p>\n<p>However, the eye need not be attracted to the symbol <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"bold\">N</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">\\mathbf{N}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"katex-html\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.68611em;vertical-align:0em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\"><span class=\"mord mathbf\">N</span></span></span></span></span>. Of course it is a very important notion in mathematics. But probably not for the topic/page that I'm writing right now. I therefore think that the blackboard bold letters (<span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"double-struck\">N</mi><mo separator=\"true\">,</mo><mi mathvariant=\"double-struck\">Q</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">\\mathbb{N}, \\mathbb{Q}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"katex-html\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.88333em;vertical-align:-0.19444em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\"><span class=\"mord mathbb\">N</span></span><span class=\"mpunct\">,</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.16666666666666666em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\"><span class=\"mord mathbb\">Q</span></span></span></span></span>, etc) strike an excellent balance: they are elegant and unintrusive.</p>",
