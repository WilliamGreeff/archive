The directions have sometimes been: descend into the mathlib dep repo, git checkout the commit, make sure the toml points to that commit, leanproject get-m, possibly other steps. Should there be a <code>leanproject get-m-at ...</code> that can take a branch name, PR #, or commit hash? It would also fetch the built oleans. I'm starting to take a look at the git python library to see how leanproject currently does HEAD fetching.</p>",
