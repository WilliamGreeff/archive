In particular, it would benefit from having <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/4241\">#4241</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/4197\">#4197</a> merged.</p>\n<p>The end result is that we get a family of polynomials over Z, that commute with each other, and such that the <code>p</code>-th polynomial is congruent to <code>X ^ p</code> modulo <code>p</code>.</p>",
