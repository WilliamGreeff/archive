From a first glance, <code>esverify</code> is a Javascript/ECMAScript verifier, and these are some semantics with soundness...</p>

<p>A slightly unusual "Lean in the wild" story:</p>
<p>My partner was out at an aerials (circus stuff) class this evening, talking to someone, who at some point in the conversation asked "Coq or Lean"? (Context: they worked in CS at a research institute here in Canberra, my partner mentioned to them I was interested in automated theorem proving.)</p>

<p>I'm not sure I know enough about schemes to know how to write them down in HOL. You essentially need to relativize everything, i.e. make every definition relative to a set. As far as I understand it, for schemes the biggest advantage of dependent types is that we can ad hoc use the subtype of a open set. This is not possible in HOL.</p>

<p>I understand from the "pitch to journalists" standpoint the 'crisis' story is great, and I fully appreciate that the mathematics literature is crap. Nevertheless, I think when talking to other mathematicians, I'd prefer to emphasise more the "this is fun" / "this isn't quite helpful yet, but if you pitch in someday soon this is going to be an awesome tool" / "if you don't pay attention now you're going to be a dinosaur" arguments.</p>

<p>"A case in point was Andrew Wiles’s proof of Fermat’s last theorem. Only a handful of experts were qualified to evaluate the dense, 200-page proof when it first appeared. "</p>
<p>This is extremely misleading. I'm not even sure that it is true, but even if it is true, within a year or two of the proof appearing there was a very detailed survey article by Darmon, Diamond and Taylor explaining the proof which needed only the kind of background which a graduate student working in this area in algebraic number theory would have, so hundreds and maybe even thousands of people were able to verify the proof within a couple of years of it appearing.</p>

<p>I could give a far harsher talk where I point out various serious mistakes by prestigious people and then point to various recent extremely technical papers by these same people which I know because of insider information did not go through as rigorous a refereeing process as they should have done and then flat out accuse the mathematical community of not having done its job correctly. I am not sure who is the crackpot but recent events in number theory have made me start to firmly believe that it's not me but them. I have thus far refrained from telling such stories in public, but believe you me this is why I am here in the formal proof verification community.</p>

<p>Exactly. There was some discussion about this a while back. The point is that however well we attempt to archive this site, you can't just email the man at Google to say "whenever someone googles for Lean questions, point them here and not at Stack Exchange please". Have you noticed more and more people coming out of the woodwork recently asking random questions? This guy today is asking about modules over a ring -- they have a mathematical background and they are going to SO not here. It's something we need to think about.</p>

<p>Let me return to the main topic of this thread today (Lean papers in ITP). It's probably obvious to computer scientists, but I prefer to write it just in case. As was pointed out to the perfectoid team, forgetting to write that Lean is developed at Microsoft research is not helping to keep Lean funded. So everybody should make sure their papers and slides mention Microsoft research.</p>

<p>Is there any effort to collect and catalog copies of all Lean papers? I would be willing to maintain a bibtex bibliography of papers. One of the key problems of doing "independent research" (as I am) is that papers get locked behind paywalls or lost due to authors leaving the field.</p>

<p>I'd like write access to someplace where people would expect to find a lean bibliography (e.g. a link on the leanprover-community page. Anybody with write access could then add bibliographic entries to their (or other's) papers. A central resource for finding biblio links would make it easier to cite papers. A central repository of copies of the papers would mean that your bibliography could also include a hyperlink.</p>

<p>I note that a discussion began in the comments at <a href="http://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?p=11053" target="_blank" title="http://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?p=11053">Woit's blog</a> .</p>
<p>I regard this sort of thing (online chat) as not unimportant. I have had over 1000 blog views in the last thee days, just from the fact that he mentioned my blog (the wordpress software tells me that people are clicking on his link) so I think we can assume (if we didn't know already) that Woit's blog is very widely read. If people feel that they have something to say about the issues being discussed there and want to contribute, I can pretty much guarantee that there is an audience reading it.</p>
<p>The reason they're not unimportant is that I am still convinced that the mathematical community is still overwhelmingly completely ignorant of software like Lean, and the more "chat" about it, the better.</p>

<p>I don't like the idea that there would be significant notational differences between  for all and lambda. I think we shouldn't have a completely different syntax for each binder. If we pick <code>.</code>, we should use it for <code>forall</code>, <code>exists</code>, etc</p>

<p>Sigh. I wish there weren't so many meaningless syntax changes. I don't really care what the syntax is, but I like consistency and these changes should be considered in the light of all the people that will have to learn the new syntax. I hope there is at least a rationale posted for all these things at some point</p>

<p>I would actually prefer to use backslash than unicode lambda (but with lambda available as alternate notation). It would be nice if the core syntax didn't use so much unicode, since this makes it difficult for those that don't want to use a lean-approved editor</p>
</blockquote>
<p>there are non-unicode alternatives for lambda, though? Just like coq, I think you can type <code>fun</code> or <code>assume</code> for lambda, and so forth. The implication arrow is the very awesome <code>-&gt;</code>. I mean, you probably know this, so I'm not quite following.</p>

<p>I'm very close to creating a Twitter account only for the purpose of voting here. <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110024">@Sebastian Ullrich</span> wouldn't it make more sense to have a GitHub vote? You could created and issue with one message per proposition, and we can use the emoji reactions to vote. I think the period option is really awful. I don't know any language (I mean real language, not programming language) where period is used for anything else than ending a sentence. In what sense does <code>λ x. e</code>ends after <code>x</code>?!? Of course every mathematician would vote for <code>x ↦ e</code> but I'd be happy to keep <code>λ x, e</code> if it is important for CS people.</p>

<p>Period is used in Isabelle. It took me a lot of time to get used to the comma in Lean, and in the end I think I prefer the period because the comma is already used to separate expressions in anonymous constructors. My point is rather that I would like to have two different symbols here, be it <code>. ,</code> or <code>, ;</code> say.</p>

<p>I'd be interested in thoughts about the arrangement of code for this sort of thing.  I think it's desirable to have a static snapshot on the arxiv and a maintained repository on github.  Certainly some of the code on my github repository could move into mathlib.  We could have a policy and/or aspiration that all code supporting a published paper should move into mathlib.  Or we could have a separate repository for that purpose, but still under leanprover-community and set up with travis so we can maintain compatibility with mathlib.</p>

<p>It's a little ambitious to expect everybody to keep their code up to date. An arxiv submission should contain git hashes of any dependent packages. Probably also a specific Lean version number too, in order to ensure reproducibility, maybe using Elan? Then even if the paper is read years later the code should still work without squiggly lines.</p>

<p>I think you're probably more concerned than I am :-) I think that when I was younger I would have been running around panicking, but now I understand the internet much better and it seems to me that most Lean stuff on the internet is sane, and then this one piece is a bit more extreme but it will just disappear into the general noise. I think much more interesting is Frank Calegari's claim that some humans completely understand the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem, so I wrote a blog post about that instead.

<p>I guess my interest in proof checking stems from a very different thing, where we have a general proof that something is (unprovable? -- i dont want to say false), but in special cases can be proven true, the general cases tend to throw shade on the special case, and the special case tends to require a lot of setup... It's probably best if I just give an example...</p>
<p>like the idea that nand has no inverse and loses information, but in the case where nand is the partial application of a reversible universal logic gate like a fredkin gate, or a toffoli gate the complete gate has an inverse.  I like proof checkers for their ability to convey all these special assumptions, when trying to convey a counterintuitive truth ... This is somewhat the dual of Kevin's what if its false when we think it true I guess.</p>

<p>This comment from Hacker News is quite a marvel:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>IMO the final paper had too much technical jargon which was convoluting some simple concepts.</p>
<p>This is symptomatic of IMHO the biggest single problem with the world of mathematics today. This discipline should be about developing ideas based on rigorous foundations and logic, which is a useful and important purpose. Once you have understood those ideas, even "advanced" results often seem quite simple and intuitive, and we can take that understanding and apply it to other work if helps us to make useful progress. However, the amount of needlessly obscure terminology, poor notation and just plain bad writing in formal papers make the whole field absurdly inaccessible, even to many who might have no trouble understanding the underlying concepts and important results.</p>
<p>Just imagine what would happen if we tried to write engineering specs or software the way postgraduate mathematics research is done. We'd be trying to debug source code where every identifier was a single character, taken from one of three or four different alphabets, with several of them looking similar enough to mistake one for another, with a bunch of combining accent modifiers on top that were used to fundamentally change the semantics of the program, interspersed with comments by someone who needs a remedial class in basic writing skills, full of technical terminology that is defined in terms of other technical terminology from other software packages, except that sometimes the meaning is subtly different in this context but that isn't noted anywhere on the screen at the time, resulting in needing to spend half an hour doing a depth-first-search of all the definitions only to find that a function whose only identifier is the name of the developer who wrote the second version (because the first person to work on it already has another function bearing their name) is actually equivalent to what a programmer would write as</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>const DAYS_IN_WEEK := 7
</pre></div>


<p>I write this as someone who studied mathematics to a high level and has touched on the field many times since in connection with heavily mathematical software development. It's the worst sort of closed-world gate-keeping, and we could do so much better, but sadly inertia and vested interests are not our friends in this matter.</p>

<p>Mathematica won in the computer algebra field for a simple reason. It had the best documentation. The learning curve for any computer algebra system is quite steep and all of the other systems relied on "learn by trial".</p>
<p>Now look at Lean. Take, for example, group.lean. It is a wall of text. Finding a theorem relies on odd names like mul_eq_of_eq_inv_mul. The whole of the "communication" with people, such as it is, is contained in that name. Programmers made the mistake of this "pile of sane" (POS) approach, witness the "src", "inc", "tst", and (usually empty) "doc" directories with "semantic naming" like parser.c, <a href="http://SMTFuns.pl" target="_blank" title="http://SMTFuns.pl">SMTFuns.pl</a>, or <a href="http://catsim.ml" target="_blank" title="http://catsim.ml">catsim.ml</a>.</p>
<p>Suppose, instead, there was a group theory textbook in latex. The textbook explains the ideas in natural language. It contains all of the lemmas in group.lean, each  one with a paragraph or so of explanation. The lemmas are in named "chunks", basically a verbatim block with a name. Lemmas should only be accepted when they contain a paragraph or section in the group theory volume.</p>
<p>Now you have a book, with a table of contents, a table of equations, chapters, sections, paragraphs, an index, and a bibliography, all hyperlinked and searchable. Since each lemma is in a named verbatim chunk you can extract any or all lemmas automatically, letting the compiler do it. You can find relevant lemmas by looking in the table of contents or the index.</p>
<p>Code to extract a named chunk is 170 lines of C. Axiom already uses this technology.</p>
<p>The idea is called "literate programming" (Knuth). You write for people, and incidently, write for the machine. And, as a benefit, you get a book to publish, which counts on your resume rather than a file of code that doesn't.</p>

<p>I'm suggesting that the "library" format for lean is books, not files.

<p>One clear problem is that probably 5% to at most 10% (just a guess, an authority can jump in if they please) of the lemmas in <code>mathlib</code> are actually even stated in a mathematics book. At the very least, in mathlib proofs of important and hard, "real", propositions and theorems are often chopped up in order to remain manageable. I think just the act of <em>stating</em> many of the broken-up pieces as they are phrased in lean would be totally unbearable to read in a mathematics book. Imagine, for example, such a direct translation of <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/master/src/group_theory/sylow.lean" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/master/src/group_theory/sylow.lean">https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/master/src/group_theory/sylow.lean</a><br>

<p>but even if it does grow to millions, most of those lemmas wouldn't benefit much from extensive documentation. <br>
i suppose the normal workflow is the following: you encounter a technical issue in one of your proofs that is intuitively obvious but would be bothersome to prove. you use library_search or some other lemma search tool to resolve the technicality, and then go on with your proof.<br>
there's really not much beyond the lemma type that matters.</p>

For instance <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/master/src/geometry/manifold/manifold.lean" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/master/src/geometry/manifold/manifold.lean">https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/master/src/geometry/manifold/manifold.lean</a>, that I wrote recently and for which the more than 100 comments in the PRs made me vastly improve the documentation. Does it correspond to what you are looking for, or how would you envision things for better documentation?</p>

<p>I'm looking at several systems (COQ, AGDA, IDRIS, HOL, ISABELLE). HOL88 is interesting because it is implemented in Common Lisp and I can embed it in Axiom directly (which is also Common Lisp). Lean is interesting in particular due to Jeremy Avigad. I used it a bit and now I'm trying to communicate between it and the compiler. Axiom is typed everywhere, at every level, and is dependently typed so I need a robust system.</p>

<p>FWIW I figure most people don't use ITPs because being formal is a chore. Nobody cares about Bourbaki, and nobody cares about convincing a computer they are correct. In that sense they are a solution in search of a problem. I think they will take off once we true believers formalize enough math and develop enough useful tactics that the software starts being a net gain in productivity as opposed to a 10x reduction.</p>

<p>Andrew, I'm not sure how far tactics can carry you toward that goal. The undecidability issue is an issue. Axiom uses heuristics at runtime to resolve type questions that can't be computed at compile time. I expect to run into the same issue once I try to prove some of Axiom's algorithms correct. Also, tactics have to somehow be related to the specification language of the algorithms and I'm not sure what to think about that connection yet. It is still an "open research question" for me.</p>

<p>The Axiom Sane project (Sane is a synonum for rational, coherent, judicial, and sound) is trying to build a bridge between these two fields, merging computer algebra and theorem proving machinery.</p>

<p>I see that Axiom wants to call Lean under the hood. Is it feasible that I could call Axiom from Lean and get a proof certificate for things that a CAS can do? For example, I would love to call out to a cylindrical alg decomp algorithm, or matrix decomposer alg, or symbolic integrator.</p>

<p>I guess in these cases it's difficult since not only the result needs to be returned, but also the sequence of transformations that lead up to it</p>

<p>Andrew, that's exactly the goal of the Axiom Sane project. Axiom should be a trusted oracle for computing algorithms. Libraries like complex numbers, computing primes, doing CAD, etc. are easy in Axiom but providing a trusted algorithm and a proof certificate is the center of the research question. The oracle response should provide the answer and a proof that the checker can check</p>

<p>I can't imagine trying to encode the Risch integration algorithm in Lean. It requires too much algorithmic machinery, most of it at the PhD thesis level. But it already exists in Axiom.</p>

<p>The idea of "encoding all of mathematics" doesn't seem to mention the computer algebra field. Certain algorithms (e.g. Buchberger's algorithm) seem to have been proven but the whole subject of Infinite Group Theory, which is mostly non-terminating procedures, doesn't seem to fit into the proof systems easily.</p>

<p>I think that Andrew's suggestion is the more profitable angle here. Rather than attempt to have lean be a component of axiom, see if you can modify axiom to produce certificates of its results that can then be checked in a theorem prover like lean</p>

<p>The problem with treating Axiom as a black box is that you don't trust it, and the very purpose of the project seems to be to make it more trustworthy. The only way you can achieve that is either by whiteboxing the algorithm and proving it correct, or by having the algorithm validate any outputs it gives by producing proofs alongside.</p>

<p>If you want ITP mathematicians you have to grow them. So you need courses. You need documentation. You need degrees which recognize programs as well as papers and books. Current mathematicians are successfully set in their ways and they know where credit lies.</p>

<p>I am taking a risk in my job by not producing the standard research papers which I used to produce. My justification for this is that I am attempting to put courses together. But I won't be able to change our UG maths degree, other than by adding a pure Lean course to it (which I no doubt will try to do at some point). It will still just be one of many.</p>

<p>We didn't prove the snake lemma in the Lean HoTT library. We actually needed very little homological algebra for our project, much less than we initially suspected. I think we proved some other lemmas, like the four and/or five lemma, but never actually used it.<br>

<p>Edit: I think I misunderstood the question, apologies. Here is what i originally wrote which doesn't  answer your questions. If you click on the link you'll see lean is already on that list. Maybe there are a some more things that have more recently appeared in mathlib that we haven't updated Freek about (mean value theorem <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="214703">@Yury G. Kudryashov</span> ?) but more-or-less the answer is we have a fair number of these goals formalized (including at least one which is present in no other system) but less than the more mature systems.</p>

<p>To answer the questions in the post:<br>
1) which of these can make use of work done in which other ones?<br>
There are two ways in which systems can make use of work in others, either via an automated conversion/ or embedding of the logic of one into the other, for this you might be interested in <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110049">@Mario Carneiro</span> 's work embedding some metamath0 proofs inside of lean, the other way is that those with similar logic can also draw inspiration / replicate ideas from one in another system more easily. For lean this would likely be coq, where a lot of work (tactics especially) in lean have learned from prior work done in coq, rather than reinvent the wheel.</p>
<p>2) which of these would be the easiest for mathematicians with some programming experience to learn to use to create machine-verifiable proofs?<br>
Lean of course ;). More seriously that's  a very difficult question to answer as the answer depends on personal preference, how much experience the user has with different types of programming languages. </p>
<p>3) which of these have a good translator that turns a machine-readable proof into something a human reader might gain insight from?<br>
None of them? ISABELLE/NAPROCHE  and forthel are projects that go in that direction, but is more aimed at writing a human readable proof that a machine can read, rather than translation. Peter Koepke and Tom Hales have thought about how this might work in lean but I'm not aware of any publications (yet).</p>

<p>I took this to mean untrained human, but for lean at least it completely depends on the style, level of comments and whether you have an interactive viewer open, if you show me a random term mode proof in mathlib without lean open what I'm going to get from it is what lemmas are used probably, wether induction is used or not, and at the end of the day I'll be reconstructing the proof "flow" in my head, I don't know what level of insight that is, compared to say a normal proof in a book or paper. I feel like this question is really getting at a system where I can show the output to a random mathematician and they will not think it looks odd (a la Ganesalingam-Gowers).</p>

<p><code>tidy</code> originated in a (completely unsuccessful) attempt to imitate what they did. Ed Ayers (who is Gowers' student) has been pursuing this properly.</p>

<p>For the record: the "completely unsuccessful" is a very modest description with a lot of irony. <code>tidy</code> is probably one of the best hidden tactics in mathlib. You don't see it, but it get's called a lot. And that's just the way it was meant to be.</p>

<p>I think it's fair to say that while it is a useful and powerful tactic, it does not really act like the Ganesalingam-Gowers prover. It's still not clear to me whether this is a failing of <code>tidy</code> or the GG prover</p>

<p>This is a bit off-topic, but this title got me thinking about lean in the wild more literally. To what extent do you think theorem provers will be present in everyday life? </p>
<p>For example, I have type 1 diabetes, and as pumps and sensors get more automated we currently can't do much more than trust that their software won't go wrong and potentially do terrible things to us. Of course there is a lot of testing that is done to prevent that, but being able to prove things about these devices seems nice to me.</p>
<p>Another thing would be voting systems, of course. And more or the sci-fi side, I wonder what would it be like to have formalized laws and jurisdictions, and lawyers who prove theorems and debate about hypothesis (but of course this kind of thing would certainly come with its own problems)...</p>

<p>One area where formalization of laws could be useful is in hours of service regulations (i.e. how long truck drivers can work). The rules can get quite elaborate, especially in the US, and in fact formalization is already underway with the move to electronic logbooks.</p>

<p>There were some debates on how one should interpret the "2 terms" rule in Russian Constitution. Putin interpreted the phrase as "no 3 terms in a row" while others did argue that it should be interpreted as "one may be a President either for 1 term in a lifetime, or for 2 terms in a row". (Later he just changed the Constitution).</p>
<p>And there was another debate a few years before Putin. The law says that a president suggest a candidate for the position of the prime minister, and the parliament votes to accept or deny the candidate. If the parliament denies 3 candidates, then elections must be held immediately. The question was: may the president suggest the same person 3 times in a row or he has to suggest 3 different candidates?</p>

<p>Disclaimer: these two paragraph were meant to be examples of difficulties with interpreting laws written in natural language. Though I have my opinion about the political situation in Russia, I would prefer to avoid discussing it here because I assume that people should be welcome to contribute to <code>mathlib</code> regardless of their political views (and thus it's better not to discuss these views unless such a discussion is required to resolve something withing the community).</p>

<p>Students at Imperial, working with preliminary versions of the definition, have proved that Gamma (Spec(R))=R and that Gamma and Spec are adjoint functors between rings and locally ringed spaces. All of this is yet to hit mathlib. We've never done products but we have tensor products so there's a clear path to it.</p>

<p>We should make a roadmap for other things about schemes. I'm working on several things still, but would prefer if other people who actually knew algebraic geometry did it. :-) Proving that sheafification is an adjunction is the most immediate need, I think, so that opens up lots of the basic categorical properties of <code>Scheme</code>.</p>

<p>In terms of a roadmap for a roadmap, we should do some thorough crosslinking of mathlib and the Stacks project. Ideally we could even produce visualisations of the Stacks tag network, coloured according to what's in mathlib.</p>

<p>I am not sure whether this counts as a roadmap, but two results that I use quite frequently are </p>
<ol>
<li>the Miracle Flatness Lemma (<a href="https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/00R4">https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/00R4</a>)</li>

<p>Henrik Lenstra always preferred bold. He told me that bold was the notation in the books originally when notation began to be standardised, and then blackboard bold was invented for blackboards, so the correct notation when working in a non-blackboard format (e.g. print)  is bold.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Henrik Lenstra always preferred bold. He told me that bold was the notation in the books originally when notation began to be standardised, and then blackboard bold was invented for blackboards, so the correct notation when working in a non-blackboard format (e.g. print)  is bold.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have a very strong opinion on this subject. It is one of the few places where I dare to disagree with Lenstra (and Serre!).</p>
<p>Typography is the art of making things invisible. If you notice the design of some piece of text, it is distracting you from the content. If something stands out, it better be important. For that reason we <em>emphasize</em> the word that is being defined in a certain definition. For that reason, it is okay to print the word <strong>Theorem 2.1</strong> in bold when you state it (but not when you refer to it, probably).<br>
In my thesis I went so far as to not have <em>any</em> bold text anywhere. But I think that judicious use of bold text is fine. If a user is searching for a theorem statement, then it can help if the eye is attracted to <strong>Theorem 2.1</strong>.</p>
<p>However, the eye need not be attracted to the symbol <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="bold">N</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathbf{N}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.68611em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathbf">N</span></span></span></span></span>. Of course it is a very important notion in mathematics. But probably not for the topic/page that I'm writing right now. I therefore think that the blackboard bold letters (<span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="double-struck">N</mi><mo separator="true">,</mo><mi mathvariant="double-struck">Q</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathbb{N}, \mathbb{Q}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.88333em;vertical-align:-0.19444em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathbb">N</span></span><span class="mpunct">,</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.16666666666666666em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathbb">Q</span></span></span></span></span>, etc) strike an excellent balance: they are elegant and unintrusive.</p>

<p>If someone would like to figure out what shorter names for everything should be, feel free to rename things (you'll probably want to do some renaming in inner product code alongside that for geometry). Likewise for shorter statements using <code>^ 2</code> (which might indicate a few lemmas elsewhere that could do with <code>^ 2</code> variants, but I expect the geometry lemmas themselves should only be stated with one of <code>^ 2</code> or <code>*</code>, not in both variants).</p>

<p>Indeed, if you wanted to compare a synthetic proof in Euclid vs a synthetic proof in Lean. What we can take OP to be, though, is a quantitative comparison of a synthetic proof with a fully unfolded one (modulo <code>tactic</code> modules and so on).

<p>I've said this elsewhere, but I think that for "named" theorems we should use the names, modified as appropriate to indicate syntactic differences when there are multiple versions of a theorem. The symbol-based name is only useful if that's the main identifying feature of the theorem, which makes it good for things like group lemmas but not so good for advanced maths theorems</p>

<p>That is, we should ask the question "what is the most likely way someone is going to attempt to find this theorem" and name the theorem after the identifying features in the head of that hypothetical someone</p>

<p>Just reading the "hacker-proof code" article and I love the correction at the end:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Correction: This article was revised on September 21 to clarify that in formally verified software, each statement follows logically from the preceding one, not from the next. </p>

<p>Perhaps they took "backwards reasoning" too literally?</p>

<p>I'm glad they clarified.  I also find it funny the article is called "Hacker-Proof Code Confirmed", and has the quote “We are much more clear about what we can and cannot do.”</p>
<p>Formal methods can show code satisfies specific properties, but it's pretty much impossible to formalize what it means for a complex system to be "hacker proof".</p>
